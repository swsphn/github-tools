# GitHub Tools

Helper tools for GitHub.

Included tools:

- Generate an RS256 signed JWT token from a private key stored in Azure
  Key Vault
- Use the JWT token and a GitHub App ID to generate a GitHub App
  Installation Token, which can be used to authenticate to GitHub as an
  app rather than a human user. (Useful for deployment scripts.)
